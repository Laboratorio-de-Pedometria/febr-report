Country Soil Information Survey
This survey is conducted by the Global Soil Partnership as a step towards establishing the Global Soil Information System (GLOSIS) through supporting member countries to develop their national soil information systems (CountrySIS) . The survey aims to assess soil databases and information systems currently existing on the national level, in order to plan global activities according to the capacities and needs of the countries. 

The PDF preview of the survey questions can be accessed here: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rboHEXP-7LO3mY9fFhivk3Gc80lcqBGa (please only use a PDF-version as a preview of the questions, and fill your answers in this Google form).

Please distribute this survey to all relevant experts/institutions which are collecting and maintaining soil information in your country. In case of several soil property databases or information systems existing in your country, please submit a separate form for each database and information system.

The terms in this survey are defined as follows:

A soil property database is a collection of measured values of soil properties organized in a digital format so that it can be easily accessed, managed and updated. The data may be associated with soil profiles (soil profile database) or with the mapping units.

A Soil Information System (SIS) is a geographic information system (GIS) for the capture, storage, management, processing and display of soil-related data from original sources. A soil property database may serve as the main component of the SIS. SIS can also include non-soil data (such as climate or land use) to support land-management decision making.

A Soil Monitoring System is based on the regular repetitive soil sampling aimed at observing the change of soil properties over time in order to control soil quality and address soil degradation.

The survey starts from questions, related to the soil property database. If the database is a part of a soil information system (SIS), it continues to describe the SIS (if not, the SIS section can be skipped). The last section is dedicated to the soil monitoring system (if it is present). 

Any issues with this form can be reported to the GSP Secretariat via GSP-Pillar4@fao.org
